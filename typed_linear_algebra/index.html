Hello, my name is François Carouge. Thank you for welcoming me to present in this session of Cpp Bay Area.<br />
Today we are going to talk about yet another type of safety in programming languages. That would be quantity or unit safety with support of the C++ type system. We will try to implement unit safety in linear algebra applications. My objective is to share with you my practical learnings about type safe matrices. I will motivate the problem, explore the ideas, introduce a solution, and share takeaways.<br />You can find this talk and the full library on GitHub at the location linked, or by taking a picture of this QR code.<br />
Please interrupt me with your questions, or note down the slide number if you prefer to bring it up during the Q&A. Let us start today with a real-world, motivating problem.

Do you know which launch this is?<br />
Yes, it is the December 1998 launch of the Mars Climate Orbiter probe. The mission lasted 286 days for 327 million dollars. Do you know how the mission concluded?<br />
Yes, the program litteraly crashed, a mission failure, the Mars Climate Orbiter probe was lost to Mars. The cause of the probe loss was an incorrect entry trajectory, 169 kilometers too close to Mars surface. The cause of the incorrect trajectory was one software producing impulse vector results in pound-force seconds, while the results fed to another software taking input in newton seconds. The unit difference meant an error factor of 4.45. The producing software did not meet the interface specifications. The specification, and then implementation, defect escaped to production due to additional causes including but not limited to, the lack of testing, verification, and validation, all contributed by economical pressure.<br />
Back in these days the software ran on different machines in different geographical locations, and results from one software to another might have been transferred by emails. I will let you decide on the tradeoffs for yourself and your projects if such an issue should receive safety hardening from the type system. If you think it does, the problem for this talk: how to build a strongly typed linear algebra library: its data structures, vectors and matrices; and its algorithms.

<aside class="notes">
You may have seen code that uses the built-in types to represent entities with additional meaning: the duration of a run in seconds or the height of building in meters. The semantic of the variable is not encoded in its type. It is sometimes implicitely attached to the variable in its name. Or it is sometimes described in a comment somewhere. Or sometimes relies on the implicit convention of systematic usage of the international system of units in a code base such that units are rarely identified explicitely. The tools struggle to protect users from invalid operations such as assiging a time to a building height. Only built-in implicit type conversion are protected with compiler flags. And without controls, resulting defects may end up crashing, on Mars.<br />
FRAGMENT<br />
You might have seen code that encodes the units, dimensions in the type system itself. Invalid conversions, operations result in compiler errors, guiding the developers. Other benefits also include shorter variable names for readability. The type provides context. There exists a variety of dimension libraries in C++, an example is that of `std::chrono` or other standardization efforts such as Mateusz Pusz's mp-units library and its quantity type. We will use this quantity type in our examples today. We will mostly talk about unit safety in this talk. Let's add in the linear algebra.

There exists a variety of linear algebra libraries in C++: the C++26 `std::linalg` combined with the C++23 `std::mdspan`, or higher order libraries such as Eigen. A common data structure type found in linear algebra is that of a colum vector, we will call that a vector. Traditional representation of the linear algebra vector can be made with `std::vector`, C-arrays, `std::span`, or an `Eigen::Vector`. Tradeoffs exists for sizes known at compile-time or at run-time, owned memory or views over a range, and linear algebra operations availability.<br />
FRAGMENT<br />
This second block of code shows what could be a first idea, a first attempt at typed linear algebra by using the quantity types in place of the built-in types. Unfortunately all linear algebra operations and libraries have been designed with assumptions of built-in types. These assumptions do not hold for types with additional semantic.<br />
FRAGMENT<br />
For example, a double multiplied by a double gives you a double, but a length multiplied by a length gives you an area. Linear algebra operations fail to compile with the strongly typed vectors. Some approaches heavily modified the linear algebra libraries to support the strong types. It is only the beginning of pain.

More difficulties arise when the linear algebra vectors have heterogenous types. The existing linear algebra libraries are simply not equipped to allow such idiomatic code.<br />
FRAGMENT<br />
And finally, C++ itself seems not to permit constuction of heterogenous initializer-lists without additional syntaxic sugar. Heterogenous initializer-lists tend to trigger internal compiler errors. What do you think? Can we design typed linear algebra using yet another level of indirection?<br />
Yes, the idea is to use an abstraction, preferably zero-cost, to provide to the user a composition of quantity types and linear algebra. And down the rabbit hole of template metaprogramming we may go.

I found these references useful in preparing this library. In 1878 the Bertrand-Buckingham π theorem proves linear systems can be rewritten in terms of a set of dimensionless parameters. Unfortunately usage in implementation is hardly systematic. Anyway the theorem does not help in exchanging physical algebraic information through software interfaces. The Bertrand-Buckingham π theorem is insufficient to provided unit safety.<br />
In 1995 George Hart informs us on the mathematical properties of dimensioned quantities. In 2002 Blair Hall identified conceptual elements of physical quantities applied to software frameworks. In 2020 Mateusz Pusz presents a C++ physical unit library. In 2021 Chip Hogg shares C++ lessons about units in matrices. In 2022 Daniel Withopf formalizes a C++ physical unit matrix. In 2023 Mark Hoemmen presents C++ std::linalg based on a subset of the BLAS standard. In 2024 Daniel Hanson showed us interoperability of Eigen and std::linalg.<br />
Daniel Withopf and Chip Hogg inform us there already exists closed-source, proprietary typed linear algebra implementations. And we can even find various open-source typed linear algebra attempts over the years. We are trying to make a general, open-source, and permissive typed linear algebra library solution.

<aside class="notes">
I author a Kalman filter C++ library. Briefly, the Kalman filter is a control theory tool applicable to signal estimation, sensor fusion, or data assimilation problems. This sample shows an implementation of the estimate uncertainty update of a Kalman filter. It is simple, yet non-trivial. A fair benchmark, objective for today. The estimate uncertainty P shown with its nine values comes from the estimation of the position, velocity, and acceleration of an object in one-dimension. There exists filters with dozens, hundreds, or more states. Filters with numerous states can get complicated. Development difficulties and safety risk arise in ensuring a parameter is used in the expected position and with the expected units. This was my motivation for the typed linear algebra library.

<aside class="notes">
The `typed_matrix` class composes a third party linear algebra matrix type. This matrix type is injected through a template parameter. Keep in mind this Matrix parameter and its usage nay need to transparently accomodate expression templates techniques. Also keep in mind the data storage own memory or view memory. The strong types of the matrix elements are encoded in a collections of types. What do you use for collections of types?<br />
Packs? Template template parameters? `std::tuple` may suffice. Why are there two collections of types? Isn't one collection of N-times-M types sufficient to encode all the individual types of the matrix?<br />
It interestingly turns out that encoding N-times-M types is quite complicated and also unecesary. Blair Hall explained a conjecture from George Hart on the properties of physical quantity linear algebra: that is for all useful physical matrices N-plus-M types suffices to represent all the valid types of the matrix. Hence we will use two collections: one for the rows, one for the columns; the element of any given type being a factor at the intersection.
Additionaly, the typed_matrix must also support the superset of operations provided by the third partly linear algebra libraries and the standard library. Lastly, the library needs to be decoupled from the linear algebra library and element type libraries. The template parameters, concepts, customization point as template specialization will help us in decoupling the dependencies.

We declared the `typed_matrix` class with its three template parameters. These template parameters are also available as member types, not shown here in this class declaration since they are merely aliases.<br />
FRAGMENT<br />
The underlying element type, such as floats or doubles of the storage matrix, will be useful for the library itself and for end-users. A naive implementation if the backend is uniformely typed then the underlying elements is that of the first element.<br />
FRAGMENT<br />
A second interesting member type is a template one. The strong type of the i-th, j-th element, for example the velocity in meter per seconds from the quantity library. The resulting type is formed by the result type of product of the i-th type of the row indexes by the j-th type of the column indexes. Importantly, note that the product template used here is not equivalent to the `std::multiplies` functional structure of the standard library. It is instead the resulting type of a multiplication that respect the strong types: the product of two lengths is an area. This is an example of the standard library not considering strong type results. This alternative product type here is implemented in terms of the resulting type from invoking the call operator of a multiplication structure. These abstractions allow for template specializations to resolve the varied use cases of template product types.

The count of rows and columns will also be useful as public member variables. And the rank, or dimension of the matrix.
These members are static inline constexpr. We will omit all attribtutes (constexpr, nodiscard, and the occasional `std::remove_cvref_t`) in the slideware today for readability. The code is also slightly simplified at times, see the library on GitHub for the details. Please, fill in attributes as we go.
We will also not deal with dynamically sized matrices today.

            <h6>Some Constructors</h6>

// Compatible copy conversion:
typed_matrix(const same_as_typed_matrix auto &amp;other);

// Singleton matrix from convertible value.
typed_matrix(
    const std::convertible_to&lt;element&lt;&gt;&gt; auto &amp;value)
  requires singleton_typed_matrix&lt;typed_matrix&gt;;
</code></pre>
<aside class="notes">
The destructor is not shown here. You can imagine a default constexpr destructor.
Neither I will show the copy- and move- assignment operators equivalent to these constructors.
Most matrice libraries made the choice of an unitialized default constructor for historical or performance reason. For a safer linear algebra library, it is appropriate to have a zero-initialized default constructor if the type-erased third party matrix type supports a default initialization. The implementation, not shown here, ensures zero-initialization.
The compatible copy conversion provide support for safely convertible but not strictly identical typed matrix. One example is that of a matrix where the rows and indexes types are merely transposed. Another example is that of the element types represent the same physical quantity type but the C++ template are not quite identical. Similarly for compatible move conversion. 
The singleton constructor helps the typed matrix to behavior more like built-in types where it can.

And we can also provide an easy construction for a column or row vector of heterogeneous quantities. Note the parameter pack with two preceding mandatory parameter to disambiguate from other constructors.
The last constructor is a sharp edge. The tradeoffs are not always easy and so we may need to be able to construct a typed matrix from its underlying matrix type. This is helpful for implementing operations without friendship, or supporting expression templates. This is a problem.

<aside class="notes">
The constructors of the typed matrix used concepts to ensure they are meanigful for a given template instantiation of a typed matrix. We show here a couple interesting concepts among the the 10 or so concepts present and used in the library.
In some cases, we want to enable behavior solely for typed matrices. This concept presented with an interesting challenge in its definition: the template parameters of the typed matrix could not be passed in the concept nor deduced. The neat idiom to permit usage of the concept while passing only the single type to check was to re-use the type's under evaluation for its member types. Note the Type parameter is found on both sides of the same type concept.<br />
FRAGMENT<br />
There will be constructors, members that are only valid, only enabled if the typed matrix is in the special case of a uniformely typed matrix. All element types are the same. The same? Is same type too restrictive? Wouldn't convertible types be a sufficient condition? But convertible to what? A common type? To one another? Exhaustively? Some questions remain open. Also note that the constexpr for or template for expression statement can often be re-written as a fold expression, we haven't found a practical nested fold expression equivalent to the nested for loops here. Note that in C++26 template for expansion statement will replace these constexpr for templates.

<aside class="notes">
It seems the best we can do for type-safe compile-time bound-checked access is the standard `at` member, providing the i-th, j-th position as non-type template parameters. I omitted the atttributes nodiscard, constexpr, rvalue/lvalue/const variants of this member. I also omit the one dimension variation of the at member.
Next is the subscript operator, another sharp edge, here we see it with deducing this to deduplicate operators. The example shown here is that of the square bracket index operator. There is also the identical historical parentheses index operator not shown here. One difficulty with this operator is the lack of possibilities to provide compile-time bound checking. Another difficulty is that in C++ the return type is fixed at compile-time. We cannot vary the return type based on the element accessed at runtime. Therefore we limit this syntax to uniform matrices to preserve our type safety. This is a problem. It may be judicious to not support this accessor at all. Similarly for the parentheses-based index access operator not shown here.
Lastly we show the third and last sharp edge, the traditional underlying data accessor member function in the typical standard. Again this will be useful for implementing operations.
Compilers still had some difficulties with the deducing this syntax in this form here in addition to the decltype(auto) return types. Some of the compilers defects have been fixed in newer version and we may be able to reduce the duplication in the library.<br />
FRAGMENT<br />
And that's it for typed matrix class declaration, we will then see interesing implementations for some of these members and operations.

Adding algorithms, or operations against the typed matrix is merely done by adding functions. We've made the choice to avoid the friendship coupling to enable extensibility.
The first two operators, the additions, are two overloads amond four variations: adding two matrices, and adding a value to a 1-by-1 matrix. There are conditions on the types added, size of the matrix, convetibility of the types.
The matrix-matrix-product operator shown here is the general case product among six other overloads.
The matrix-matrix-divison operator, also has six overloads. It has the particularity to be configurable via yet another customization point object to select the end-user's prefered division implementation from a matrix decomposition solver. Matrix division divides the community. Pun intended. Should it exist? In which cases? Remember linear algebra is not commutative, a matrix may not have an inverse, and there may exists multiple different solutions to the same division.
The transposed operation shown here is not done in place.
The scale operation, alpha x, done in place here, imposes dimension less restrictions on the scalar, because the index types of the typed matrix are fixed.
All in all the library wants to provide a drop-in support for both Eigen and `std::linalg` matrix algorithms were possible.

At CppCon 2023 Mark Hoemmen introduced us to `std::linalg` coming to the standard. His talk included an abstraction layer nomenclature that I paraphrased here. On top of the hardware we find the fundamental support, used by performance primitives where specialized performance hardware implementation are reasonable. Themselves used by the low-level linear algebra mathematics which can be applied to domain specific problems such as statistical inference, physical simulation, control theory. 
Where would you placed the typed linear algebra support in this table? Perhaps somewhere between application specific high-level mathematics and/or around low-level mathematics? Experimentation seems to support either.

<aside class="notes">
A variety of implementation compositions were explored. At the high-level math applications the Kalman algortihms were the principal motivation.
For low level math, both Eigen and LAPACK have shown to be usable.
And the underlying performance primitives, operations, and solvers can be chosen at linking, loading time. The native Eigen kernels, the BLAS implementation, or Nvidia BLAS implementation, and C++26 std::linalg have shown to be ussable.
As far as element type goes, we've talked here about mp-units, and std::chrono. There is a quirky property that emerges from the compositions. It turns out, that fundamental are valid element types, after all, they are in the classical linear algebra. This property allows to create a drop-in replacement typed linear algegra type. Even more curious, the underlying matrix type of the typed matrix can be a nested typed matrix itself! This property will come in handy in future work.</aside>

And now the actual usage. The state column vector x0 is a heterogenously typed vector of position and velocity. The library's std::formatter specialization makes the vector printable.
The at member permits to access the element both to write a new value to the element, or to read the element value.
What do you think is the result of the row-vector--column-vector product?<br />
FRAGMENT<br />
A compilation error. In traditional libraries this incorrect operation compiles and returns a one element matrix. However with typed linear algebra, the programming error is caught at compilation time.<br />

The intended operation was the column-vector--row-vector product and yields a 2-by-2 matrix.

Interestingly, no memory ownership assumption constrain the typed matrix. Therefore the typed matrix can compose a `std::mdspan`. Here, the typed column vector is defined with `std::mdspan`, the chosen underlying data representation, and an equivalent column `std::extends`.<br />
FRAGMENT<br />
In this example, the data owning storage is a `std::vector`, the fundamental matrix is the `std::mdspan`, and the typed matrix becomes the performance primitive. The `std::linalg` operations and solvers are overloaded, composed into their equivalent strongly typed functions. The owning, or non-owning nature of the typed matrix is transparent. A compilation error occurs when the user attempts an incompatible operation. For example, when trying to use an operator, let's say a sum, of two matrices. The operation fails to compile because there cannot be memory allocation for the returned result.

The simplified implementation of the `at` member function shown here introduces the customization point object `cast`. This element caster objet allows the end-user to teach the library how it can convert underlying type to and from quantity types. This single abstraction is the only place where the explicit conversions take place. For the mp-units quantity library the template specializations of the customization point use the explicit `numerical_value_in` quantity member function to obtain the underlying type value or inversely equip the underlying type value with the reference unit. Note the difficulties in preserving the value category of the type for rvalues and lvalues. The implementation can be thought of the equivalent of the standard library forward-like utility, with an injected cast, and index look up and verification.

The matrix-matrix product shows a few of the techniques needed to implement the operations. The operations are totally external, no operations are member functions, no friendship.
The operations leverage ADL, overloads, and concepts to transparently select the most appropriate implementation.
Overloads for matrix-vector products, matrix-scalar products, singleton products are provided, not shown here.
This is the generic matrix-matrix product. Operations typically follows this idiomatic implementation: first verify linear algebra and type safety requirements, contracts, assertions; second express the return row and column index types; third and last perform the operation through the backend and using a factory function to decay and forward the resulting types while retaining the expression templates of the backend. 
For the matrix-matrix product, it appears that the resulting type is the matrix where the row index types are constituted by the product of the left-hand-side matrix row index types with the 0-th column type, and equivalently for the resulting column index types.
What do think you are some of the requirements, assertions, or contracts needed to ensure the matrix-matrix product is a correct and safe operation?

A second requirement is that each of the element products are compatible, convertible to their sums.
And we can see here a typical naive compile-time assertion over the types of the matrix-matrix product. One issue here is that the compiler error is unreadable when the user attempts an invalid product. Another issue is an apparent equivalent reimplementation of the underlying backend operation for the purpose of type verication, a good argument for the library backend to support strong types directly.

I will close today's session by looking toward the future. We've now seen the principles driving a strongly typed linear algebra with examples of implementation and usage. That's only the beginning. Unfortunately unit and dimension are incomplete for a more comprehensive safe physical linear algebra! Additional safety capabilities are critical to consider such as quantity kind, character semantics, index access, or reference frames. I want to explore these areas, perhaps with yet another composition.<br />
FRAGMENT<br />
Additionally, we need greater compatibility, support with the standard library, `std::linalg`, third party linear algebra, and third party types. I believe typed linear algebra could be a drop-in retrofit in existing high order libraries while maintaining zero-cost for performance.

<b>Typed Linear Algebra</b><br />
Quantity-Safe Linear Algebra Use Case: Eigen + mp-units<br />
<br />
A practical approach to achieving quantity-safe linear algebra in C++ through the composition of the Eigen and mp-units libraries. The proposed method integrates dimensional analysis in linear algebra computations, ensuring compile-time enforcement of unit correctness while preserving the efficiency and flexibility of established numerical backends. Design principles, implementation strategies, and accumulated experience, including trade-offs in type representation and performance considerations. Lessons learned highlight the feasibility and challenges of embedding strong typing into numerical computation, while preliminary extensions demonstrate the applicability of the approach beyond physical units.</p>

To summarize our journey today.
We composed a matrix into a typed matrix to facade the physical quantity types.
The linear algebra operations are forwarded to their equivalent backend while enforcing the type safety.
End-user inject type conversion in a single customization point.
We leverage deducing this to provide a single implementation for the 2, 4, 8, 16 repetitive function versions.
We used template for expression statement to perform compile-time verification over vectors and matrices.
We kept the library transparent to third party expression template design.

<aside class="notes">
The design presents many improvement opportunities.
A low hanging opportunity is the printing format which is a minimal implementation that follows the standard library default without any of its formatting options.
There may be opportunities to simplify the implementation with the C++26 template for expansion statement. 
Another opportunity is the library supports the latest versions of the three major compilers and the tip of the supporting libraries. Compatibility and stability is a fun challenge a number of bug reports and fixes have been generated in these projects.
Benchmarking is required to demonstrate the abstraction remains zero cost to enable adoption.
`std::linalg` in C++ 26 comes with many more operations to support. I wonder if reflection could help in generating the operation wrappers for the typed matrices.
I have reached a similar conclusion to Daniel Withopf presentation in 2022 that is, safe linear algebra with physical quantities require index safety. The at member should not use i, j indexes but strongly typed indexes encoding things like the reference frame, character of the quantity, or additional semantic. I suspect there exists an opportunity to implement index safety by yet another composition over the typed matrix, perhaps an indexed matrix.
Finally, there are Jacobian and Information matrices which may need an additional exponent for their type collections to differentiate their taxonomy in operations.
These are just a few of the next steps.
